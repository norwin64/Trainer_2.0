which contains ``several screens``.
- Homescreen
- stack-screeen
- edit_vocab_screen
- settings_screen
- vocab_screen
- end_test_screen
- end_training_screen

## The vocab trainer includes ``3 modes``, which are explained in the app:

## In the settings menu you can ``edit`` 3 things in the design:
- Color of the background
- Fonts of the texts
- Number of vocabs in test mode
